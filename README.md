# Extended Kalman Filter Project

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Complete the Extended Kalman Filter algorithm in C++.
* Ensure that your project compiles.
* Test your Kalman Filter against the sample data. Ensure that the px, py, vx, and vy RMSE are below the values specified in the rubric.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/748/view) Points
###Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

---
### Compiling
#### 1. Your code should compile.  

The code compiles without errors with cmake-3.7.2 and make-3.81 on macOS-10.12.4.


### Accuracy
#### 1. The px, py, vx, vy output coordinates have an RMSE <= [0.08, 0.08, 0.60, 0.60] when using the file: "sample-laser-radar-measurement-data-1.txt".
